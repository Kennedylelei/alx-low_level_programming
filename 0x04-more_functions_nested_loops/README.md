PROJECT 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

Nested loop means a loop statement inside another loop statement. That is why nested loops are also called as â€œloop inside loop"

Note: The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h ~ You have to start by creating your main.h first.
